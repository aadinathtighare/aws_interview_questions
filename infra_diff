if I hosted my application on ec2 servers with ASG auto scaling then I buikd & deploy new code so every time I need to create new servers in my ASg group.
but in eks k8s cluster I need to build new image with new code and deploy it in eks cluster so no need to re-create underlying infra ?
I m right ?
-->💬 So yes — you are 100% correct:

In EKS, you only build a new Docker image and redeploy it —
you don’t need to recreate EC2 servers or node groups.
The existing cluster infra handles your new app versions smoothly. ✅
---------------
🔍 Quick Comparison
Feature	EC2 + ASG	EKS (Kubernetes)
Deployment Unit	AMI / Code on EC2	Docker Image
Infra Change Needed for New Version?	✅ Often Yes	❌ No
Rollback	Revert AMI / Redeploy	Just change image tag
Deployment Speed	Slow (minutes)	Fast (seconds)
Auto Scaling	Whole VM	Pod level
Cost Efficiency	Less (static)	High (shared infra)
