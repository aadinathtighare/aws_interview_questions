ðŸ”¹ DevOps Interview Questions & Answers (5+ YOE)
1. What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?

CI: Developers frequently merge code to a shared repo; automated builds/tests run.

CD (Delivery): Code is automatically built, tested, and ready for deployment, but requires manual approval.

CD (Deployment): Fully automated release to production with no human intervention.

2. How do you achieve zero downtime deployment in Kubernetes?

Use Rolling updates (kubectl rollout).

Configure readiness/liveness probes.

Use HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for scaling.

Optionally use blue/green or canary deployments via tools like Argo Rollouts / Flagger.

3. How do you handle disaster recovery for EC2, RDS, and S3?

EC2: Use AMIs, snapshots, cross-region backups, launch templates.

RDS: Enable multi-AZ, automated backups, cross-region read replicas.

S3: Versioning + Cross-region replication (CRR) + lifecycle policies.

4. What are EKS Managed Node Groups vs Self-managed Nodes?

Managed Node Groups: AWS manages node lifecycle (patching, upgrades, replacement). Less operational overhead.

Self-managed: You launch EC2 instances and manage scaling/patching yourself. More control, but more ops burden.
ðŸ‘‰ In production: Managed Node Groups are widely used unless you have custom AMI/kernel needs.

5. What are Kubernetes Admission Controllers and why are they used?

Admission Controllers intercept requests to the API server before persisting.

Types: Validating (enforce policies), Mutating (modify requests).

Example: NamespaceLifecycle, LimitRanger, PodSecurityPolicy, OPA Gatekeeper.

Use cases: enforce resource limits, security, policies, inject sidecars automatically.

6. How do you upgrade/downgrade an application with no downtime?

Blue-Green Deployment: Deploy new version alongside old one, switch traffic.

Canary Release: Release to small % of users, gradually increase.

Rolling Update: Replace pods one by one (K8s default).

Rollback via kubectl rollout undo if issues.

7. How do you manage secrets in DevOps pipelines?

Avoid hardcoding in repos.

Use Vault (HashiCorp Vault), AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets (with encryption at rest).

In Jenkins: use Credentials plugin.

Mask secrets in logs.

8. What are Terraform Null Resources and why are they used?

null_resource has no infrastructure mapping.

Used for provisioning actions like running scripts (local-exec, remote-exec).

Example: run configuration commands after creating infrastructure.

9. How do you connect multiple EC2 instances across regions?

Use VPC Peering (for private comms).

Or Transit Gateway (for large-scale multi-VPC).

Or VPN / Direct Connect (secure hybrid setup).

Ensure Security Groups/NACLs allow traffic.

10. What is the difference between SLA, SLO, and SLI in SRE?

SLA (Agreement): Formal contract with customer (e.g., 99.9% uptime).

SLO (Objective): Internal target to meet SLA (e.g., 99.95%).

SLI (Indicator): Measured metric (latency, error rate, availability).

11. How do you monitor Kubernetes clusters?

Prometheus + Grafana for metrics.

Alertmanager for alerts.

ELK/EFK for logs.

Jaeger/Zipkin for tracing.

Use K8s native metrics-server + HPA for autoscaling.

12. What is the difference between CloudFront Signed URL vs Signed Cookies?

Signed URL: Restrict access to a single object.

Signed Cookies: Restrict access to multiple objects.
ðŸ‘‰ Used to deliver paid/private content securely.

13. How do you handle a Jenkins job stuck at "Waiting for next available executor"?

Check Manage Nodes & Clouds to ensure executors are available.

Increase executor count.

Verify agent is connected and online.

14. How do you SSH into an EC2 instance if CPU is 100% and itâ€™s unresponsive?

Use SSM Session Manager (no SSH needed).

Or detach EBS volume â†’ attach to another instance â†’ fix issue â†’ reattach.

Or stop instance â†’ change instance type (more CPU) â†’ restart.

15. What are the main AWS services that are global (not region-specific)?

IAM

Route 53

CloudFront

WAF / Shield

Organizations
