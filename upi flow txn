Q. when payer send money via paytm so what is the flow of requests it touches which servces?
-->
💰 Scenario:

User (Payer) → sends ₹500 to another user (Payee) via Paytm UPI.

You press “Send Money” → “To Mobile Number” → Confirm → Enter UPI PIN → Money sent.

⚙️ 1️⃣ Step-by-step Flow (High Level)
Step	Description	Typical Service
1. User action	Payer opens Paytm app, selects recipient, enters amount	Mobile App (Frontend)
2. API Request	App sends API call to Paytm backend via HTTPS (REST/gRPC)	API Gateway / Load Balancer
3. Authentication & Session Check	Validate payer’s identity (token, device, etc.)	Auth Service / Token Service
4. Account lookup	Find payer’s VPA (e.g. ramesh@paytm) & bank details	User Service / Account Service
5. UPI Request generation	Create UPI transaction request and route to NPCI (UPI switch)	UPI Payment Service
6. PIN validation	UPI PIN verified via bank’s PSP (bank API integration)	Bank Integration Service / PSP Service
7. Transaction Processing	Money debited from payer’s account and credited to payee	Transaction Service / Settlement Service
8. Status update	NPCI response → Paytm updates payment status in DB	Notification Service / Transaction DB
9. Notification & SMS	Both payer and payee get success message	Notification / SMS / Push Service
🧩 2️⃣ Flow (Simplified diagram in words)
Mobile App  
   ↓  
API Gateway  
   ↓  
Auth Service  
   ↓  
UPI Payment Service  
   ↓  
Bank PSP (through NPCI)  
   ↓  
Receiver Bank  
   ↓  
Response back → Paytm Backend  
   ↓  
Notification Service → User

🔐 3️⃣ Main Microservices Involved
Service	Function
API Gateway	Entry point — receives request from mobile app.
Auth Service	Validates login, tokens, security.
User/Account Service	Manages user’s VPA, linked bank info.
UPI Payment Service	Handles UPI request creation and communication with NPCI.
Bank Integration / PSP Service	Connects Paytm to user’s bank for debit/credit via UPI.
Transaction Service	Records transaction, maintains ledger.
Notification Service	Sends SMS, push, and email updates.
Analytics / Logging Service	Logs events for tracking and fraud detection.
🧠 4️⃣ Extra: NPCI (UPI Switch) role

Paytm doesn’t directly move money —
it sends request → NPCI (UPI switch) → which routes it to payer and payee banks.

NPCI validates UPI PIN + bank response → sends success/failure back to Paytm.

🔄 5️⃣ Final Response

Paytm backend gets NPCI success response → updates database → notifies both users in real-time.

🔍 6️⃣ In Marathi-English mix Summary:

जेव्हा payer Paytm वरून पैसे पाठवतो —
App request करते → API Gateway → Auth Service → UPI Payment Service → Bank Integration → NPCI → दुसऱ्या बँकेकडे → Response परत Paytm कडे → Notification user ला.

म्हणजेच UPI payment flow मध्ये multiple microservices काम करतात — Auth, User, UPI, Bank, Transaction, आणि Notification.
