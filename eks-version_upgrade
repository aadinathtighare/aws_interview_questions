Q. i hv eks cluster i want to do version upgrade so can I create new node group with new version in same eks cluster ?
Q. if I drain and cordan old nodes in old node group then how to migrate workload ?
its automatic or manually ?
👉 Workload migration is AUTOMATIC, but you trigger it manually.

Cordon/Drain → manual action (by you)

Pod rescheduling → automatic (by Kubernetes)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PDB is VERY important exactly in the node drain / upgrade situation you described. “During voluntary disruptions (like drain, upgrade), how many pods are allowed to go down at a time.”

It protects your application from downtime.
