Q. i hv eks cluster i want to do version upgrade so can I create new node group with new version in same eks cluster ?
Q. if I drain and cordan old nodes in old node group then how to migrate workload ?
its automatic or manually ?
👉 Workload migration is AUTOMATIC, but you trigger it manually.

Cordon/Drain → manual action (by you)

Pod rescheduling → automatic (by Kubernetes)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PDB is VERY important exactly in the node drain / upgrade situation you described. “During voluntary disruptions (like drain, upgrade), how many pods are allowed to go down at a time.”

It protects your application from downtime.

apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: app-pdb
  namespace: default
spec:
  minAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
-----------------------------
❌ PDB mhanje “pod old node var chaluch pahije” asa nahi

✅ PDB mhanje “cluster madhe kamit kami 1 pod running pahije”

Pod:

Old node var asu shakto

Kinva new node var asu shakto
================
PDB ensures that during node draining, Kubernetes evicts pods gradually so that the minimum required pods remain available, enabling zero-downtime upgrades.
===============================================
🔹 Commands to test PDB behavior
# kubectl get pdb -A
# kubectl describe pdb app-pdb
===================================================
what is the kind for cluster autoscaler ?
Cluster Autoscaler (CA) itself is typically installed as a Deployment object.
kind: Deployment

Q. in eks during eks version upgrade i created new node group with new version so after workload migration is completed from old node group to new node group 
which node group I can delete ?
--> In an EKS version upgrade scenario where you have already created a new node group and migrated your workloads, you should delete the Old Node Group (the one running the previous Kubernetes version).
------------------------
Q. in my case what i did i created new node-group with new version & upgrade the old node group ?
--> In your specific situation, since you have both a new node group (at the new version) and an upgraded old node group (now also at the new version), you technically have a "Blue-Green" setup where both groups are now identical in version.

You should delete the New Node Group that you created as a temporary migration target.
