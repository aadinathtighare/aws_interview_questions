ðŸ§© What is Lambda@Edge in CloudFront ?
--> Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run AWS Lambda functions at CloudFront edge locations (i.e., near users).
Itâ€™s basically serverless code running close to your users, triggered by CloudFront events â€” without provisioning servers.
You attach a Lambda@Edge function to a CloudFront distribution.
It runs automatically when specific CloudFront events happen.

Events where Lambda@Edge can run:
-->
Viewer Request â€“ before CloudFront checks the cache (when user makes a request).
Origin Request â€“ before CloudFront sends the request to your origin (like S3 or EC2).
Origin Response â€“ after CloudFront gets response from origin.
Viewer Response â€“ before response is sent back to the user.
