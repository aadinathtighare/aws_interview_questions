Q. we hv worker nodes node group so I m keeping min maz desired values there so how they are reach max capacity , is there any autoscaling policy in my eks ?
--> Cluster Autoscaler 
is a component that automatically increases or decreases the number of nodes in your EKS node group based on pod scheduling needs.
===============================================
ðŸ§  How it works:

Pods pending â†’ means no space to schedule
â†’ Cluster Autoscaler requests AWS to add new node (up to max limit).

Nodes underutilized â†’ means very few pods running
â†’ Cluster Autoscaler can remove extra nodes (down to min limit).

Desired capacity changes dynamically between minâ€“max values.
